  <h3>My Tech Journey</h3>
  <p>So anyone who knows me, knows how my tech journey has been like a rollercoaster. There are moments where I have felt I'm on track and headed towards a successful career and there are times I wonder what I'm doing. Over the last few months I've been trying to get back on track and focus on one thing, because in the past I've been know to jump ship from on track to another, I've done front end one day and the next day I'm learning Kotlin. But they say jack of all trades, master of none. So technically I've decided to focus on one thing, to become a master of one, everytime I jumped ships I've always come back to one thing and that is Front End Web development.</p>
  <p>So this whole blog feels like I'm just rambling, but I'm getting to the point. I came to know about HNG internship a year ago, and I've been waiting for the cohort announcement. So when I joined the zuri training and was on their mailing list, I was sent an email to enroll for the internship.</p>
  <p>To anyone feeling like they have tried so many times to get up but they are still falling like me, don't be ashamed to restart, remember to write your goals down on what you wish to achieve and work towards them. Hold yourself accountable and push yourself to become better. This blog is my accountability partner and I'll keep writing more articles on it on the progress I've made so far.</p>
<p>Here are my goals for the internship:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Sorely focus on Front End</li>
    <li>Deliver timely and well done work </li>
    <li>Continue learning and getting better</li>
    <li>Network</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for today until next time, bye :)</p>
